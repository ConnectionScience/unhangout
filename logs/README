Filtering content from the log file 
-----------------------------------

--> cat filename.txt| grep regex | cut -d ':' -f 7 
  
    Combination of cat, grep and cut command is used to filter data from a log file.
    Cat command opens file and outputs its content to pipe '|'. After that grep reads from pipe and tries to match with
    the regular expression regex in the file. Cut command looks for a character following the delimiter (-d) in the 
    file and removes sections from each line of files. 
    
    
--> To further filter the content, file can be opened with vim editor and regex command can be applied.
    
    Regular expression used to retrieve chat data : :%s//}g 
    
    This expression looks for a '}' character in the entire file and wherever it finds a character matching 
    similar regular expression it removes it from the file.
